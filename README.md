# Programming Theory Algorithms ðŸš€

School projects & personal explorations in **graph algorithms (DFS, BFS), optimization (knapsack, TSP/PVC)**, and moreâ€”implemented in **Go, C, and JavaScript**. Also included: my Angular learning journey!  

### Key Topics  
- **Graph Algorithms**: DFS, BFS, shortest path  
- **Optimization**: Knapsack problem, Traveling Salesman (PVC)  
- **Languages**: Go, C, JavaScript (+ Angular experiments)
